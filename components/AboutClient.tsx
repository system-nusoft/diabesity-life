                <p>
                  This devastating link between diabetes and obesity, is not a
                  statistic. It&apos;s our parents, our siblings, our friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We saw a nation grappling with the world&apos;s highest rate of
                  diabetes, yet facing a wall of misinformation, stigma, and
                  resources that didn&apos;t fit our culture or our lives. The advice
                  was generic, the meal plans were foreign, and the conversation
                  was happening in whispers, if at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We knew we couldn&apos;t stand by while this silent epidemic stole
                  the health and futures of millions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, we built the solution we needed.{" "}
