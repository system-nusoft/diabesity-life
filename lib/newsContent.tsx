        <p>
          Pakistan is facing an unprecedented health crisis as diabetes rates
          continue to surge across the nation. With over 33 million Pakistanis
          living with diabetes, the country now has one of the highest prevalence
          rates globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple factors contribute to this alarming trend, including rapid
          urbanization, sedentary lifestyles, dietary changes, and genetic
          predisposition. The shift from traditional diets to processed foods high
          in sugar and unhealthy fats has played a significant role.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Key Contributing Factors</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Urbanization and increasingly sedentary work environments
          </li>
          <li>
            Dietary changes favoring processed and fast foods

          <li>Lack of awareness about diabetes prevention</li>
          <li>Limited access to healthcare in rural areas</li>
          <li>Genetic predisposition among South Asian populations</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-6">
          Healthcare experts emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive prevention
          programs, increased public awareness, and better access to diabetes
          screening and management services across Pakistan.

          The Prime Minister of Pakistan has launched a nationwide diabetes
          prevention and management program in response to alarming statistics
          showing that over 33 million Pakistanis are living with diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comprehensive program includes free diabetes screening in government
          hospitals, subsidized medications for low-income patients, and nationwide
          awareness campaigns about healthy lifestyle choices.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Program Highlights</h2>
        <p>
          The initiative focuses on early detection, prevention through lifestyle
          modifications, and improved access to treatment. Special emphasis is
          being placed on rural areas where healthcare facilities are limited.
        </p>

          Public health officials hope this program will help reverse the growing
          diabetes epidemic and improve the overall health outcomes for millions of

        <p>
          Pakistan has emerged as having one of the world's highest diabetes
          prevalence rates, with approximately 26.7% of the adult population
          affected by the condition. Despite these alarming statistics, the
          country continues to struggle with a lack of focused prevention
          strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The healthcare system's emphasis remains largely on treatment rather
          than prevention, leaving millions at risk of developing this chronic
          condition. Experts argue that a paradigm shift is urgently needed to
          address this growing crisis.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Prevention Gap</h2>

          Current healthcare policies allocate minimal resources to preventive
          measures such as public education campaigns, early screening programs,
          and community-based interventions. This reactive approach has proven
          insufficient in curbing the diabetes epidemic.

          Scientists have announced a major breakthrough in diabetes medication
          development, with a new class of drugs showing exceptional promise in

          Initial results indicate significant improvements in glycemic control
