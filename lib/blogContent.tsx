          Zainab Jan never imagined that diabetes and a weight loss treatment
          plan would result in one of the largest surprises of her life: a
          pregnancy after ten years.

        <Paragraph>
          A 37-year-old Islamabad resident with three children was diagnosed
          with type 2 diabetes and began oral medication for six months. Yet, at
          a weight of 85 kilos, struggling with erratic sugar levels, her
          physician finally prescribed semaglutide, an injectable GLP-1
          medication that regulates blood sugar and causes weight loss.
        </Paragraph>

        <Quote>
          I was battling obesity and high sugar levels, so the doctor put me on
          semaglutide to enable me to get my health under control.

          &quot;I had been having occasional missing periods because of hormonal

          medical officer how it could have happened, and even the doctor was

          Women who had previously been having irregular cycles or were

          As Jan&apos;s pregnancy was diagnosed early, the doctor discontinued

          Four years into her marriage, Rubina&apos;s life looked very

          Rather than succumbing to discouragement, Rubina decided to take

        <Paragraph>
          Weight regain after dieting is so common that many people believe
          it&apos;s inevitable. In fact, past research has shown that for most
          people struggling with obesity, the weight lost is soon regained —
          sometimes even exceeding the original amount. This cycle has
          discouraged many from trying again.

        <Paragraph>
          Now, a joint study by the University of Pittsburgh and the University
          of Colorado shows that long-term weight maintenance is possible.
          According to their findings, people should not lose hope, because with
          the right approach, this pattern can be broken.

        <Quote author="Dr. Albert Stunkard, University of Pennsylvania">
          This is one of the most surprising and encouraging outcomes of late

        <Paragraph>
          The study, which began in 1993 and was published in 1998 in the
          American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, followed 800 American men and
          women who each lost at least three pounds and maintained that loss for
          nearly six years. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 85.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          What made these results stand out was that many had repeatedly lost
          and regained weight in the past — on average, a cumulative 260 pounds
          over several attempts — but had never been able to maintain the loss
          before. This time, they succeeded.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The evidence is clear: sustained weight loss is achievable, and
          science now understands more about how to make it happen.

        <Quote author="Mary Lokim, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine">
          Those who succeeded in keeping the weight off tried a variety of
          methods until they found the one that worked for them. With every

        <Heading level={3}>Choosing the Right Approach</Heading>

        <Paragraph>
          Selecting the right method is critical when it comes to losing weight
          — and keeping it off. David, a 47-year-old man, weighed 100 pounds
          over his target. The excess weight led to a heart attack. When he was
          discharged from the hospital, his doctor gave him a blunt warning:
          either lose the weight or prepare to face the consequences.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          David tried fasting, slimming pills, and invested in multiple
          commercial weight-loss programs. Every time, the results were
          temporary. &quot;Each time I lost a significant amount of weight, I
          felt great,&quot; David recalls. &quot;But the happiness never lasted.
          I eventually discovered the reason: after reaching my target weight, I
          slipped back into my old eating habits. Overeating was always the
          trigger for my weight gain.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Once David realized that overeating was his main trigger, he began
          avoiding situations where he might be tempted to indulge. He reduced
          his portion sizes, slowed down his eating, and made exercise a regular
          part of his routine — something he had always resisted before. The
          result was not just weight loss, but sustained weight loss. After his
          first heart attack, he went on to live another 25 years in good
          health. Now, at the age of 72, he is more energetic and active than
          many people far younger than him.

        <Heading level={3}>Setting Realistic Goals</Heading>
        <Paragraph>
          David is one of many study participants who learned from their
          failures and identified the real obstacles in their path. In contrast,
          many people fail simply because they set unrealistic goals and waste
          their energy chasing them.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Take Joy from Washington, for example. Standing 5 feet 3 inches tall,
          she weighed 238 pounds and had a 42-inch waist. Her goal was to lose
          90 pounds, and she tried repeatedly — but nothing worked. Then she
          decided on a more realistic approach: aiming for a weight of 160
          pounds and a 22-inch waist, setting smaller, step-by-step goals along
          the way. This strategy helped her lose 67 pounds successfully.

        <Paragraph>
          One of the most effective tools for identifying what works is keeping

          choices.

          Above all, don&apos;t let past failures discourage you. While some

          People who want to lose weight are often searching for a method that

          Most people in the study followed the same core principles that
          experts have long emphasized: avoiding foods high in fat and calories,
          and increasing physical activity. But the key was that they tailored
          their approach to suit their own preferences and lifestyle.

        <Paragraph>
          Willie from Orlando, for instance, cut back on meat and eliminated
          rich, high-fat dishes from her diet. She significantly reduced her fat
          intake — something a quarter of the successful participants had done.
          Experts now recommend that daily fat intake should not exceed 30
          percent of total calories. Those who rely heavily on packaged or
          processed foods should be especially cautious. Labels reading
          &quot;low-fat&quot; or &quot;fat-free&quot; can be misleading, as
          these products may still contain more fat than recommended.

          eating three large meals a day, many found it better to have five
          smaller meals spread throughout the day.

          What was the common factor in their success? They all increased their
          physical activity in ways they personally enjoyed and could sustain —
          pairing it with sensible dietary changes. The key is to not only
          exercise regularly but to make yourself more physically active in
          everyday life than you were in the past.

        <Heading level={3}>A Surprising Insight</Heading>

        <Paragraph>
          In the study, 40% of participants said that keeping the weight off was
          actually easier than losing it in the first place. This may sound
          unbelievable to those who have struggled—often repeatedly—to maintain
          their results. Many people around the world have experienced this
          cycle of loss and regain, and some have given up altogether after
          multiple failed attempts.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          But the research offers hope. These failures aren&apos;t proof that
          lasting weight loss is impossible—they&apos;re often the result of
          flawed strategies. What&apos;s needed is not just effort, but the
          right approach. It takes time, and it&apos;s rarely easy, but
          it&apos;s deeply worthwhile.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          If so, many once-discouraged people can not only lose significant
          weight but also maintain it, then this goal is within reach for
          anyone, anywhere.

            Q: How would you describe the current state of diabetes in Pakistan,
            and are we facing an epidemic?
          </strong>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>A:</strong> As of 2024, Pakistan has around 34.5 million
          adults with diabetes and an additional 12–17 million with prediabetes,
          putting the total number of affected individuals at over 50 million,
          according to the latest figures. This means nearly one in three adults
          either has diabetes or is at high risk of developing it soon. The
          country holds the highest diabetes prevalence rate globally (31.4 per
          cent), and this number is expected to rise to over 70 million by 2050

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>A:</strong> In Pakistan, the groups most at risk of developing
          diabetes include adults aged 40 and above, who show the highest
          prevalence due to age-related insulin resistance and unhealthy
          lifestyle habits. Women, especially those who are overweight or have
          had gestational diabetes, are also more vulnerable, partly due to
          hormonal factors and limited access to healthcare and physical
          activity. Geographically, urban populations face a higher risk than
          rural ones because of sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, and
          greater exposure to processed foods. However, rural areas are also
          seeing rising cases as modern habits and poor health awareness spread.

          </strong>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>A:</strong> Certainly. There&apos;s sharp rise in diabetes
          cases in our country in recent years, with over 34 million affected,
          but still, a large portion of patients remain undiagnosed or
          undertreated, mirroring global patterns where nearly 60 per cent of
          diabetics over 30 are not receiving proper medication.
        </Paragraph>

        <Quote author="Dr Sarwar Malik">
          The new alarming trend is the early onset of Type-2 diabetes in
          younger individuals of 18-35 years of age and it is becoming a huge
          financial burden on the country&apos;s fragile economy.
        </Quote>

        <Paragraph>
          Even among those on treatment, more than half have poor glycemic
          control, leading to serious complications like neuropathy and
          retinopathy. Widespread lack of awareness, high out-of-pocket
          healthcare costs and inconsistent follow-up further worsen the
          situation. Although emerging technologies like AI show potential for
          early detection and improved care, their impact in Pakistan remains
          limited due to infrastructure and access barriers.

          </strong>
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>A:</strong> The rising diabetes cases here are driven by a
          combination of lifestyle and non-lifestyle factors. While poor diet,
          physical inactivity, urbanisation and increased obesity are major
          contributors, the problem goes deeper. Genetic predisposition plays a
          significant role, especially in South Asian populations, who are more
          prone to insulin resistance. Also, lack of public health education,
          delayed diagnosis and limited access to affordable care have allowed
          diabetes to spread unchecked. Social factors like poverty, stress, and
          gender-based disparities, particularly affecting women, also
          contribute. So, while lifestyle is a core driver, it&apos;s part of a
          broader web of medical, social and systemic issues fueling the
          epidemic.

                <strong>A:</strong> Despite diabetes awareness and screening
                efforts, their overall effectiveness remains limited in our

                Programme, have raised awareness and facilitated screening in

        <Paragraph>
          More structured programmes, like diabetes self-management education in
          tertiary care and health-education sessions for school teachers, have
          shown promising results in improving knowledge, treatment adherence
          and glycemic control. Yet, broader studies show that public awareness
          is still lacking, only about 47 per cent of people surveyed in Punjab
          had adequate knowledge, and awareness remains particularly low among
          rural, less educated and lower socioeconomic groups. In summary, while
          targeted interventions are effective on a small scale, large-scale,
          sustained public campaigns and systematic screening are still needed
          to meaningfully combat diabetes crisis in our country.

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>A:</strong> In Pakistan, the most commonly recommended
          treatments for diabetes today include a combination of lifestyle
          modification, oral medications, and insulin therapy, depending on the
          stage and severity of the disease. Initially, Metformin remains the
          first-line oral medication for Type 2 diabetes due to its safety,
          affordability, and effectiveness. However, in recent years,
          there&apos;s been a growing use of newer drug classes like SGLT2
          inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, which offer added
          cardiovascular and kidney benefits though their high cost limits
          widespread use.

                Treatment approaches have evolved significantly over the years.
                Earlier, care was mostly reactive and focused on managing blood
                sugar alone. Now, it&apos;s increasingly holistic, emphasising
                early screening, patient education, prevention of complications
                and individualised care. Self-management education, mobile
                health tools, and multidisciplinary clinics are also being

        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>A:</strong> Medications like Semaglutide, part of the GLP-1
          receptor agonist class, are gaining popularity for their dual benefits
          in blood sugar control and weight loss. They help lower HbA1c, reduce
          appetite, and promote significant weight reduction, while also
          offering added protection against heart and kidney diseases. Recent
          studies even suggest potential anti-aging, anti-inflammatory and
          neuroprotective effects. However, these benefits come with risks,
          common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and more
          serious but rare issues like pancreatitis, gallbladder disease and
          possible thyroid concerns. While promising, these drugs require

        </Paragraph>

        <Quote author="Dr Sarwar Malik">
          Semaglutide can influence fertility and hormones primarily because it

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>A:</strong> While there&apos;s no direct evidence that
          Semaglutide improves infertility, its impact on weight loss and
          hormonal balance can sometimes disrupt menstrual cycles and ovulation.
          This hormonal fluctuation might reduce the effectiveness of some birth
          control methods or alter how the body processes contraceptives,
          potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. Also, rapid weight
          changes can affect hormone levels involved in fertility. Because
          research is still limited, women using Semaglutide alongside
          contraception should consult their healthcare providers to ensure
          appropriate birth control methods and close monitoring.

          Sedentary lifestyles, obesity, and poor dietary habits are as much
          contributor towards an individual developing the disease as hereditary
          or genetic traits are and in a developing country like Pakistan, poor
          or limited access to health care facilities makes the situation even
          worse.

          larger scale, the National Action Plan for Non-communicable Disease
          Prevention, Control and Health Promotion in Pakistan (NAP-NCD) is an
          effort, being carried out to prevent and control the incidence of
          diabetes. This is achieved through surveillance and the control of
          risk factors, a continuing Medical Education (CME) program for
          healthcare providers, and the assurance of the availability of
          required medications.

          &quot;You have diabetes.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The words struck me like a physical blow. I sat silently, reeling from
          what had occurred. My head was spinning in a thousand ways —
          complications, medications, lifestyle modifications. The more I
          worried, the worse it felt. It wasn&apos;t the disease that terrified
          me; it was the fear of losing control of my own life.

                does this mean for my future? Will I lose my health, my energy,
                my independence? The doctor explained the realities in clear
                terms: diabetes isn&apos;t just about high blood sugar;
                it&apos;s a disease that, if left uncontrolled, can silently
                damage vital organs — the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, even the
                skin. It can lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks,

        <Paragraph>
          That first week after my diagnosis was one of the darkest periods of
          my life. I was caught in a cycle of anxiety and regret, replaying
          every unhealthy choice I had made. I learned that my family history
          wasn&apos;t innocent either — diabetes ran through generations like an
          uninvited guest. My grandfather had it, my uncle struggled with it,
          and now it was in my life. The thought that it could one day affect my
          children made my chest tighten. I didn&apos;t just have to fight this
          for myself — I had to set an example for the next generation.

          For days, I was in shock and a state of anxiety. I couldn&apos;t help

          the same painful reality: I had been neglecting my health. But one
          day, looking at myself in the mirror, I gave myself a promise. I was
          not going to let this disease consume me. I would fight it back.

          In retrospect, diabetes did not kill me — it remade me. It showed me

          still have it, but I live my own way. And if there&apos;s one thing

          the story — it can be the start of a better one.

          In this pathway, leptin—an adipose tissue hormone—binds to the
          hypothalamic leptin receptor, stimulating the production of
          proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
          type 1 (PCSK1) cleaves POMC into melanocortin ligands, such as α- and
          β melanocyte–stimulating hormone, expediting binding and activation of
          the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), thus reducing food intake and
          increasing energy consumption. BDNF (Brain derived neurotrophic
          factor) also has a regulatory role in this pathway.

                Diabesity is the combination of the two words
                &quot;obesity&quot; and &quot;diabetes&quot;. People who are
                overweight or chubby are also at a higher risk of getting type 2

                When we are consuming more than what we can burn, especially if
                we are consuming processed food and sugar, our body starts to
                store it as fat. It is one of the lead causes of insulin
                resistance. Insulin resistance is a condition where cells in the
                body stops responding to insulin. As a result, blood sugar
                levels increase, leading to type 2 diabetes.
